Most Conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous. \n\n A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a Duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. \n\nIf multiple Effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own Duration, but the condition’s Effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t. \n\nThe following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition."

For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on Ability Checks. \n\n An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion Effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1. \n\n Finishing a Long Rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink."
